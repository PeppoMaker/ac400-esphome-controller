- [LILYGO TTGO T-U2T USB to TTL](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-u2t)
- 5V DC power supply (‚â•1A recommended)
- 2‚Äì5A fuse (fast/slow depending on motor spec)
- RC snubber or MOV surge protection across relays
- Proper cabling (1‚Äì1.5 mm¬≤ for mains)

## üìë Software

ESPHome config file: [`firmware/ac400.yaml`](firmware/AC400.yaml)

Flash it with ESPHome and add the device to Home Assistant.

## üì∑ Wiring diagram

> Never enable more than one speed at the same time!  
> The YAML enforces an **interlock** to avoid that.

üîå Typical connections
On the LilyGo T-Relay each relay has 3 pins: COM, NO (Normally Open), NC (Normally Closed).‚Ä®You will use COM + NO.
1. Relay 1 (GPIO21 ‚Üí rel_low)
    * COM ‚Üí one side of the Low button contact
    * NO ‚Üí the other side of the Low button contact
2. Relay 2 (GPIO19 ‚Üí rel_med)
    * COM ‚Üí one side of the Medium button contact
    * NO ‚Üí the other side of the Medium button contact
3. Relay 3 (GPIO18 ‚Üí rel_high)
    * COM ‚Üí one side of the High button contact
    * NO ‚Üí the other side of the High button contact
4. Relay 4 (optional, GPIO5)
    * Can be used for Master Power (same principle: in parallel with ON/OFF button)

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not connect mains power directly to the ESP32 board ‚Äî the relays must always be wired to the low-voltage control side of the AC400 buttons, never to the motor supply lines.
